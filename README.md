# Project_4_Mario_Game

This is a terminal based game with a familiar storyline (Bowser kidnapped the princess and it's up to Mario to rescue her).
It was created using Object Oriented Programming principles in the C++ language. The game is played with basic keyboard command inputs to 
move Mario around the board and solve the 'puzzle' in each room.
